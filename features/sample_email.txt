Hello Upasita,

This is a sample email text to test your features against, e.g. the identification of sentence boundaries, capitalization, etc. I've 
intentionally done some things in this email that do indeed naturally occur in the Enron corpus (i.e. instances where capital letters DO NOT naturally
follow periods, examples where they do, and capitalization in other places
UNRELATED to the beginning of sentences. Dr. Julia Taylor would likely want us to take such things into account. You're doing a good job, I just wanted to give you some additional confounding variables to take into account. Thanks,

Mr. Dan O'Day, M.S. Technology
